The client is who we want to please. We could enjoy making something that satisfies ourselves, but that won't necessarily pay the bills. I say this every time. Communication is king. Clear communication with the client. Clearly communicating the requirements to the team. Communicating clearly within the team to get to the common goal. The user stories help start the process. By being a series of answered quesitons, they provide insight into what the user is thinking about a particular aspect of the project. This will make it easier for the tester and developer to create the desired outcome. By using Test Driven Design as part of the agile approach, the team can recreate the requirement by making the test first.The program can then be written to pass the test which will then satisfy the customer. Each team member should be willing and able to take part as any role within the team. Being open and honest (communication) will help each team member develop trust with the others and believe that they all can fill the roles. 
I would like to take all of what I've learned and adapt it to where it's needed in my real world situations, but I know that will take time. For a starter, I think the burn-down chart is the most effective for me. It gives a clear understaning of what is needed as the project starts. Then as time progresses, stories move to the completed side, showing how the team has come along and what is left to complete.
